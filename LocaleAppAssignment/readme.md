# README.md for Localization Example in .NET 6 MVC Application

## Application Description
This application serves as an example of implementing localization within a .NET 6 ASP.NET Core MVC framework. Designed as a modular and scalable template, it aims to provide a foundation for developing multi-lingual web applications. Out of the box, it supports English, French, and Ukrainian languages and comes with built-in utilities for formatting numbers, date/time, and units of measurement according to local standards.

The primary focus of the project is to demonstrate best practices in software internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n). Features include URL-based locale switching and robust fallback mechanisms for missing translations or unsupported locales. This example serves as a practical guide for developers looking to extend their applications' reach across different markets and user bases.
